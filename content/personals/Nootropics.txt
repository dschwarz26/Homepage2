<p>After over a year of procrastinating, I am finally performing my duty as a citizen-scientist and investigating nootropics.  (Technically I started a year ago with DHA, but omega-3s have the benefits of being (1) low-hanging fruit, (2) a preventative measure, not an enhancer, (3) socially acceptable, and (4) completely harmless.)</p>

<p>Currently my stack is DHA, potassium, green tea (l-theanine and caffeine), creatine, piracetam, and choline.</p>

<p>My research sources primarily come from <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Nootropics"> and <a href="www.reddit.com/r/nootropics">, as well as the relevant wikipedia articles.</p>

<p>I plan to update this post based on whatever I learn that is in contrast to the expected benefits, both above and below expected performance.</p>

<p>I have found a noticeable increase in lucidity as well as mental reaction time/acuity.  It is hard to compare this increase with the general increase with time that I’ve had all of my life so far.</p>

<p>My alcohol tolerance is astonishingly high.  This change happened rapidly within 2 weeks of beginning the stack and only decreased temporarily when I took a week off all nootropics.</p>

<p>My mental health is shattered.  I assign a <5% chance that there is any connection with this and the nootropics, as I have undergone significant upheaval in my life.</p>

<p>I am still not nearly as awake as I’d like to be for as long as I’d like to be.</p>

<p>I took a six month break after Burning Man 2013 until starting work at Google. During that time I felt that I wouldn't have benefited from cognitive enhancement, as I wasn't producing intellectual work. I'm struggling against a tendency to self-handicap - by not using all available cognitive resources, I can feel better about mistakes that I make and opportunities that I miss.</p>

<p>Now that I'm at Google, and I'm operating at a near maximal intellectual capacity, I am restarting my usage.</p>
